        <h3>About Lido&rsquo;s Cafe and Bakery</h3>
        <p>Proud owners Don and Shawna Rivera would love to welcome you to Lido&rsquo;s warm atmosphere and fantastic home cooking!</p>

        <p>Shawna started her career as a cosmetologist. After fifteen years, she decided she wanted to follow her passion for cooking and went to culinary school at LederWolff Culinary Academy. After graduation, Shawna opened Lido, a café and hair-salon. It&rsquo;s been great having her family, including her husband and co-owner Don, together working as a team on what it is she loves to do! The café has become "the Best Kept Secret in Carmichael" because to this day someone will always say, "I never knew you were here and I&rsquo;ve lived here for so many years!"</p>

        <p>Shawna&rsquo;s dream for Lido&rsquo;s came from her mother&rsquo;s gift of cooking and how it &rsquo;brings you home&rsquo;.</p>

        <p>Lido&rsquo;s is our home and we love to have you come, eat and visit. We can&rsquo;t do it without you!Thanks to everyone who has been a part of Lido&rsquo;s!</p>
